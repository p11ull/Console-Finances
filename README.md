# Console-Finances

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to create code for analysing the financial records of a company.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
 I wanted to showcase my Javascript skills 
- What problem does it solve?
The records were analysed to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset.
  * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
  * The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

- What did you learn?
I took the starter code and refactored it to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.
